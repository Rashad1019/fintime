# Fincent Architecture

Personal financial research terminal: Streamlit UI over a layered Python core.
Rule of the house: **UI at the edges, pure logic in the middle.** Only `pages/`,
`app.py`, and `data/cache.py` may import Streamlit; everything else is plain
Python that works from scripts and tests.

## Layers and data flow

```

  ▼
app.py + pages/            Streamlit UI (widgets, spinners, error display)
  │           │
  │           ▼
  │      config.py          shared constants (DCF assumptions, periods)
  ▼
data/cache.py              st.cache_data facade + parallel watchlist fetch
  │                        (the ONLY data module pages import)
  ▼
data/yahoo.py              pure fetch/parse: ONE .info call → snapshot
  │            └─ on failure ─▶ data/fallback_source.py (raw Yahoo chart API)
  ▼
analytics/                 pure math: ratios.py, dcf.py, risk.py
agents/                    personas.py (prompts) + openrouter_client.py (LLM)
storage/db.py              SQLite watchlist (path injectable)
formatting.py              single source of display formatting (UI + prompts)
```

**The snapshot** is the core data contract, produced by `yahoo.fetch_snapshot`:

```python
{
  "quote":        {ticker, name, price, market_cap, currency},
  "fundamentals": {...} | None,          # None on the degraded path
  "source":       "yahoo" | "fallback",  # UI shows a warning when degraded
}
```

One `yf.Ticker(t).info` call produces both quote and fundamentals, so they can
never disagree and the API is hit half as often.

## Design decisions (and why)

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| `data/yahoo.py` is Streamlit-free; caching lives in `data/cache.py` | Scripts, tests, and future features (alerts, screeners) can reuse fetching without a Streamlit runtime |
| Snapshot marks its `source`; pages surface a ⚠ when degraded | The old code silently fell back — you could analyze N/A-filled data for days without knowing |
| Failures are logged (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`, warnings to stderr) | The old `except Exception: pass` destroyed the evidence needed to debug data outages |
| Watchlist fetches run in a `ThreadPoolExecutor` inside one cached function | Fixes the N+1 serial loop; threads run only pure code, so no Streamlit-context issues |
| `config.py` owns DCF assumptions and period lists | Analytics and Agents previously had separate copies that could silently drift |
| `formatting.py` is used by both pages and persona prompts | One percent/ratio/money format everywhere; prompt numbers match what the UI shows |
| `storage/db.py` resolves path: argument → `FINCENT_DB_PATH` → project root | Tests use `tmp_path` and can never touch the real watchlist |
| `OPENROUTER_MODELS` env var overrides the hardcoded free-model rotation | Free-tier models get removed upstream; refresh the list without a code change |
| Analytics returns `None` for undefined (P/E with negative EPS), raises `ValueError` for invalid input, data layer raises `DataSourceError` | "No answer" and "bad request" and "source down" are different situations and pages handle them differently |

## Error-handling conventions

- **`DataSourceError`** — raised by `data/` when no source can provide data;
  pages show `st.error` and stop.
- **`OpenRouterError`** — raised by the LLM client with an actionable message
  (missing key, all models rate-limited, bad response shape).
- **Degradation over failure** — quotes fall back to the chart API's last
  close and are *marked*, never silently substituted.
- **No swallowed exceptions** — every fallback path logs a warning with
  `exc_info` before proceeding.

## Testing

`uv run pytest` — 56 tests, no network required:

- `test_ratios / test_dcf / test_risk / test_personas` — pure math and prompts
- `test_yahoo_parsing` — info-dict parsing, dividend-yield normalization,
  fallback degradation (yfinance monkeypatched to fail), chart-payload parsing
- `test_openrouter_client` — model rotation on 429/404, env overrides,
  fail-fast on non-retryable errors (fake HTTP responses)
- `test_storage` — temp-file DB round-trips, normalization, env path override
- `test_formatting` — ratio/percent/money rendering

## Known limits (accepted for a single-user app)

- `get_snapshots` caches on the whole ticker tuple — adding one symbol
  refetches all (in parallel, so cheap at personal watchlist sizes).
- Snapshot TTL is 300s for fundamentals too (was 3600s) — slightly more
  fetches in exchange for quote/fundamentals never drifting apart.
- On Streamlit Community Cloud the SQLite watchlist is ephemeral and shared
  across viewers — keep the app restricted to your own account.
